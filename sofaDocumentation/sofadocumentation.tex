\section{Document structure}
This document gathers the content of other documents located in different subdirectories. These documents can also be compiled as stand-alone documents.
The structure can be illustrated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{sofaDocumentation/sofadocumentation.tex} : the root document.
 \item \texttt{macros\_docu.tex} : custom commands and macros. This file is included by the root document.
 \item \texttt{introduction} : a subdirectory containing a chapter of this document.
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{introduction.tex} : a stand-alone article containing the same. This file may include \texttt{../macros\_docu.tex} to use the common custom commands.
 \item \texttt{introduction\_body.tex} : the text of the chapter/article. This file is included as a chapter by \texttt{sofadocumentation.tex}, and included as full article text by \texttt{introduction.tex}.
\end{itemize}
 \item there could (and hopefully will !) be other subdirectories with a similar structure.
\end{itemize}

\section{Compiling the document}
\subsection{File formats}
The graphics are handled by: \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage[pdftex]\{graphicx\}}. This allows the inclusion of \texttt{.png} images rather than \texttt{.eps}, which makes the image files much smaller, and compilation of \texttt{html} faster. The result of the compilation is a \texttt{.pdf} rather than a \texttt{.dvi} file.

\subsection{Include paths}
The root document includes files in the subdirectories, which in turn include files too. The path from the subdirectory (used when compiling a stand-alone article) is the same as from the parent directory (used when compiling the whole report).

\subsection{HTML}
HTML can be generated using the following command:\\
\texttt{latex2html sofadocumentation.tex -mkdir -dir ./html -show\_section\_numbers -split 1}
\\
Currently, the listings do not appear in html.
