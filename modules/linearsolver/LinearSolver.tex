%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   LOGO  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
introducing the simulation scene graph where there are mapped ms, mapping, interaction forcefield between real DOF and mapped MS

\subsection{Direct Solvers }
Present here the matrix structure in the generale case, where there are several mapped mechanical states and interactions between them. Explain the structure : principale blocs, diagonal bloc (self-stiffness), non-diagonal blocs (interaction-stiffness), mapping blocs J can be seen as a bloc ...
\subsection{Context in SOFA }
Identifying the problem in SOFA where there are a scene but not all nodes has stiffness, or not all mapping has matrix J
